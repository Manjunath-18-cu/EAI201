Assignment WEEK-1 Report
Project Understanding & Planning

Introduction
Navigating a university campus can be confusing, especially for first-year students, visitors, or even staff. Finding the right classroom, building, hostel, or café often takes more time than expected. To solve this problem, Bot Brain is designed as a smart campus navigation assistant for Chanakya University.
This project combines a user-friendly chatbot interface with graph-based search algorithms and detailed campus data. The system helps users quickly locate buildings and find the shortest, most efficient paths across campus. By acting as a virtual guide, Bot Brain simplifies navigation and saves valuable time—making life easier for everyone on campus.

Problem Statement
Students, staff, and visitors at Chanakya University often face challenges such as:
•	Difficulty locating departments, classrooms, and other facilities on campus.
•	Delays in getting answers to common questions.
•	Reliance on manual help for basic information, leading to inefficiency.
These issues result in confusion, wasted time, and a less-than-ideal campus experience, particularly for newcomers.

Objectives
The key goals of this project are to:
•	Develop a chatbot that can answer frequently asked questions related to the university.
•	Integrate campus navigation features to guide users to various locations.
•	Create a structured database with information about departments, staff, and facilities.
•	Improve accessibility to information and reduce the need for manual support for routine queries.

Scope
The project will include:
•	A chatbot that provides answers to FAQs, directions, and department-related queries.
•	Navigation support limited to the boundaries of Chanakya University campus.
•	Accessibility via both web and mobile platforms.
•	Possibility of future enhancements such as sentiment analysis or multilingual support.

Requirement Collection
To build the system effectively, the following data will be collected:
•	Detailed campus layout and maps.
•	Information about university departments and a staff directory.
•	A collection of frequently asked questions from various departments (admissions, academics, facilities, etc.).

Tools & Technologies
The project will use the following technologies:
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Chatbot Framework: Dialogflow
•	Database: Graph-based data structures implemented in Python
•	Navigation Support: Google Maps API
